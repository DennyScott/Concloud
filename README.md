FINDING FURTHER README FILES
================================							

There are README files placed throughout this project.  Other then the README.md file in the regualr directory, these other README.txt files are to be deleted upon placeing something in the directory.  They are only in these directories as GIT will no add empty folders, so they're simply placeholders until actual files have been created.

HOW TO MAKE FEATURES/CHANGES
==================================

If you are making a new feature, or changing an existing one, simply fork this project make your feature branch, merge it with your master, and then send a pull request to myself.  Make sure you describe your changes so I can understand them easily, and keep up to date on the pull as I may be sending comments and questions back.  Make a pull for each feature so when you send the pull requests to me, I can see individual features, rather then one gigantic one. This will help with both merging, and mostly if one feature has faulty code, not losing all features.  PLEASE DO THIS!!!!

FINDING A BUG
====================================

If you find a bug but are apparently to lazy to fork and pull to me, or your busy with other bugs/feature make sure you at least list it in my issues section for Concloud.  If you do, then I can comment on it with the rest of the team, and we wont forget bugs and someone will fix them.  Thanks! :)
